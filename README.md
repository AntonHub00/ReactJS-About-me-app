# "About me" app

This was app was created to test my skills with basic React components
interaction.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Characteristics

- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- React Router to show main and section-details views
- Mock data. All app data is got from a JSON file and display dinamically
- Route validation (at least the app does not break)
- Fully responsive
- Dynamic color cards (every time the main/sections view is re-rendered a random
  valid color is choosen for the cards)
